Create a new deployment called nginx-deploy, with one single container called nginx, image nginx:1.16 and 4 replicas. The deployment should use RollingUpdate strategy with maxSurge=1, and maxUnavailable=2.
Next upgrade the deployment to version 1.17.
Finally, once all pods are updated, undo the update and go back to the previous version.
