How many nodes exist on the system? Including the controlplane node.
--> k get nodes

Do any taints exist on node01 node?
--> k describe node node01 | grep -i taints

Create a taint on node01 with key of spray, value of mortein and effect of NoSchedule
--> k taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule

Create a new pod with the nginx image and pod name as mosquito.
--> k run mosquito --image nginx

What is the state of the pod
--> k get pod mosquito
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mosquito   0/1     Pending   0          78s

Why do you think the pod is in a pending state?
--> POD Mosquito cannot tolerate taint Mortein


Create another pod named bee with the nginx image, which has a toleration set to the taint mortein.
--> k apply -f bee.yaml
        ---
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
        name: bee
        spec:
        containers:
        - image: nginx
            name: bee
        tolerations:
        - key: spray
            value: mortein
            effect: NoSchedule
            operator: Equal
    

Do you see any taints on controlplane node?
--> k describe node controlplane | grep -i taints
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule

Remove the taint on controlplane, which currently has the taint effect of NoSchedule.
--> k taint node controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
node/controlplane untainted
