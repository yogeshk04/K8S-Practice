A pod definition file nginx.yaml is given. Create a pod using the file.
      ---
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
      name: nginx
      spec:
      containers:
      -  image: nginx
         name: nginx

--> kubectl apply -f naginx.yaml

What is the status of the created POD?

--> k get pod
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   0/1     Pending   0          40s

Why is the POD in a pending state?

Hint: Check the status of the scheduler in this cluster. Is it running?

Manually schedule the pod on node01.

--> k get nodes 
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
controlplane   Ready    control-plane   9m51s   v1.26.0
node01         Ready    <none>          9m16s   v1.26.0

      ---
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
      name: nginx
      spec: 
      nodeName: node01   # Update the nodeName into manifest file
      containers:
      -  image: nginx
         name: nginx

Now schedule the same pod on the controlplane node.

      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
      name: nginx
      spec:
      nodeName: controlplane # Update the nodeName into manifest file
      containers:
      -  image: nginx
         name: nginx
